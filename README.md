CO1
Able to understand and design the solution to a problem using object-oriented programming concepts.
CO2
Able to reuse the code with extensible Class types, User-defined operators and function Overloading.
CO3

CO4
Implement the features of C++ including templates, exceptions and file handling for providing programmed solutions to complex problems.
Programming Assignments:
1. Write a C++ program to sort the elements in ascending and descending order.
2. Write a C++ program to find the sum of all the natural numbers from 1 to n.
3. Write a C++ program to swap 2 values by writing a function that uses call by reference technique.
4. Write a C++ program to demonstrate function overloading for the following prototypes.
add(int a, int b)
add(double a, double b)
5. Create a class named Shape with a function that prints "This is a shape". Create another class named Polygon inheriting the Shape class with the same function that prints "Polygon is a shape". Create two other classes named Rectangle and Triangle having the same function which prints "Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon" respectively. Again, make another class named Square having the same function which prints "Square is a rectangle".Now, try calling the function by the object of each of these classes.
6.Suppose we have three classes Vehicle, FourWheeler, and Car. The class Vehicle is the base class, the class FourWheeler is derived from it and the class Car is derived from the class FourWheeler. Class Vehicle has a method 'vehicle' that prints 'I am a vehicle', class FourWheeler has a method 'fourWheeler' that prints 'I have four wheels', and class Car has a method 'car' that prints 'I am a car'. So, as this is a multi-level inheritance; we can have access to all the other classes methods from the object of the class Car. We invoke all the methods from a Car object and print the corresponding outputs of the methods.
So, if we invoke the methods in this order, car(), fourWheeler(), and vehicle(), then the output will be

3
I am a car
I have four wheels
I am a vehicle
Write a C++ program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance using this. 7. Write a C++ program to create a text file, check file created or not, if created it will write some text into the file and then read the text from the file.
8.Write aC++ program to write and read time in/from binary file using fstream 9. Write a function which throws a division by zero exception and catch it in catch block. Write a C++ program to demonstrate usage of try, catch and throw to handle exception. 10. Write a C++ program function which handles array of bounds exception using C++.
Assessment Details (both CIE and SEE)
The weightage of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) is 50% and for Semester End Exam (SEE) is 50%. The minimum passing mark for the CIE is 40% of the maximum marks (20 marks out of 50). The minimum passing mark for the SEE is 35% of the maximum marks (18 marks out of 50). A student shall be deemed to have satisfied the academic requirements and earned the credits allotted to each subject/ course if the student secures not less than 35% (18 Marks out of 50) in the semester-end examination(SEE), and a minimum of 40% (40 marks out of 100) in the sum total of the CIE (Continuous Internal Evaluation) and SEE (Semester End Examination) taken together.
Continuous Internal Evaluation(CIE):
Two Unit Tests each of20 Marks (duration 01 hour)
• First test after the completion of 30-40 % of the syllabus
• Second test after completion of 80-90% of the syllabus
One Improvement test before the closing of the academic term may be conducted if necessary. However best two tests out of three shall be taken into consideration.
Two assignments each of 10 Marks
The teacher has to plan the assignments and get them completed by the students well before the closing of the term so that marks entry in the examination portal shall be done in time. Formative (Successive) Assessments include Assignments/Quizzes/Seminars/ Course projects/Field surveys/ Case studies/ Hands-on practice (experiments)/Group Discussions/ others. . The Teachers shall choose the types of assignments depending on the requirement of the course and plan to attain the Cos and POs. (to have a less stressed CIE, the portion of the syllabus should not be common /repeated for any of the methods of the CIE. Each method of CIE should have a different syllabus portion of the course). CIE methods /test question paper is designed to attain the different levels of Bloom’s taxonomy as per the outcome defined for the course.
The sum of two tests, two assignments, will be out of 60 marks and will be scaled down to 30 marks
CIE for the practical component of the Integrated Course
• On completion of every experiment/program in the laboratory, the students shall be evaluated and marks shall be awarded on the same day. The15 marks are for conducting the experiment and preparation of the laboratory record, the other 05 marks shall be for the test conducted at the end of the semester.
• The CIE marks awarded in the case of the Practical component shall be based on the continuous evaluation of the laboratory report. Each experiment report can be evaluated for 10 marks. Marks of all experiments’ write-ups are added and scaled down to 15 marks.
• The laboratory test (duration 02/03 hours) at the end of the 14th /15th week of the semester /after
26.10.2022

completion of all the experiments (whichever is early) shall be conducted for 50 marks and scaled down to 05 marks.
Scaled-down marks of write-up evaluations and tests added will be CIE marks for the laboratory component of IPCC for 20 marks.
Semester End Examination (SEE):
SEE for IC
Theory SEE will be conducted by University as per the scheduled time table, with common question papers for the course (duration 03 hours)
1. The question paper will have ten questions. Each question is set for 20 marks.
2. There will be 2 questions from each module. Each of the two questions under a module (with a maximum of 3 sub-questions), should have a mix of topics under that module.
3. The students have to answer 5 full questions, selecting one full question from each module.
The theory portion of the Integrated Course shall be for both CIE and SEE, whereas the practical portion will have a CIE component only. Questions mentioned in the SEE paper shall include questions from the practical component).
Passing standard:
• The minimum marks to be secured in CIE to appear for SEE shall be 12 (40% of maximum marks-30) in the theory component and 08 (40% of maximum marks -20) in the practical component. The laboratory component of the IPCC shall be for CIE only. However, in SEE, the questions from the laboratory component shall be included. The maximum of 04/05 questions to be set from the practical component of IPCC, the total marks of all questions should not be more than 30 marks.
• SEE will be conducted for 100 marks and students shall secure 35% of the maximum marks to qualify for the SEE. Marks secured will be scaled down to 50.
